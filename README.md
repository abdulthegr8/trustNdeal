# TrustNDeal Android App

TrustNDeal is a mobile application designed to provide a secure and reliable platform for buying and selling goods locally. This README provides an overview of the app, its features, and the technology stack used in its development.

## Features

TrustNDeal offers a range of features aimed at ensuring safe and trustworthy transactions for both buyers and sellers:

1. **Secure Meeting Locations**: Buyers and sellers can choose from pre-approved secure meeting locations, such as police stations or well-known retail stores, to complete their transactions. This minimizes the risk of fraud or theft.

2. **Escrow Account**: TrustNDeal uses a separate escrow account to hold funds during a transaction. The buyer's payment is held until the seller confirms the goods have been delivered as described, ensuring both parties are protected.

3. **User Ratings and Reviews**: Users can view the ratings and reviews of other users to assess their reputation and make informed decisions when interacting with others on the platform.

4. **24/7 Customer Support (Future Feature)**: TrustNDeal aims to provide a 24/7 customer support team in the future to assist users with any issues or concerns that may arise during transactions.

## Technology Stack

TrustNDeal is built using the following technologies:

- **Android Studio**: The app is developed using Android Studio, a popular integrated development environment (IDE) for Android app development.

- **Firebase**: Firebase is used for various backend services, including real-time database management, user authentication, and cloud functions.
